## Dependency Management

During the deployment process, Kinsta will automatically install dependencies defined in your `package.json` file.

## Web Server Setup

### Port

Kinsta automatically sets the `PORT` environment variable. You should **not** define it yourself and you should **not** hard-code it into the application.

### Start Command

When deploying an application Kinsta will automatically create a web process based on the content of `Procfile` as the entry point.

## Deployment Lifecycle

Whenever a deployment is initiated (through creating an application or re-deploying due to an incoming commit) the `bundle install` command is run.

## What is Jekyll
**Jekyll** is a static site generator. It takes text written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static website. You can tweak the siteâ€™s look and feel, URLs, the data displayed on the page, and more.
